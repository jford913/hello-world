Hello Fellow Githubbers!

My name is Jori and I'm diving back into programming after having been out of practice on new back end technologies.  I've not done much since PHP 4 was a big deal...yup, it's been that long.  Now I'm getting familiar with Python, refreshing my front-end skills w/ HTML5 & CSS3.  Excited to be here.  Hopefully I can help with some UI design for some projects.
